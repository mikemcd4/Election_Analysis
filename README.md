# Election Analysis using Python

## Project Overview

In this assignment, with the use of Python, I performed an election audit of a hypothetical election in the state of Colorado. The Colorado Board of Elections had the following requirements for the audit:

  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Election-Audit Results

This information generated from the python script would give a clear picture to the Board of Elections on who the winner of the election was, while providing data as evidence to back up the results. After running the script, the following output displays on the terminal, providing insight into the election.

As seen above, a total of 369,711 votes were cast, with Denver County having the highest number of voters, and Diana DeGette ultimately winning the election with nearly 74% of the total vote.

## Election-Audit Summary

This script was both extremely efficient and functionable in providing insight into the election. This script could be modified by a campaign manager or other staff member to dive deeper into the numbers, by looking at city and municipality data, rather than just from the counties as a whole. Or, taking a step back, data from entire states could be collected for a national election. Other variables to consider tracking data on in an election include age, race, gender, and yearly income. The data from these variables could be added to the .csv file and inputted into the existing script to paint a more clear picture on election trends.
